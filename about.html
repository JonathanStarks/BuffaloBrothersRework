Some sanding and drilling will be required to fit our grips. All grips are shipped as one-piece grips unless the gun specifically requires screw mounting.

Grips returned in the same unaltered condition, suitable for resale, can also be exchanged. Grips paid for by credit card of PayPal are subject to our standard 10% restocking fee.</p>
            <h4>Additional Information</h4>
            <p>We have been making grips since the 1990's. Our grips are made of polyurethane (also known as resin), which we treat to get the finished color and antique look that our grips are renowned for. Over five years of research and development went into our grips before they were introduced to the marketplace. </p>
